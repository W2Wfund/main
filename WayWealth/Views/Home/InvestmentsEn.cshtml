This technology has been created in 2009, together with cryptocurrency bitcoin. Her creator it is considered to be Satoshi Nakamoto, which nobody managed to reveal the personality still. The blockchain is public and at the same time protected. It is provided thanks to:

Each happening transaction is coordinated with some time interval. All data are public. Now the blockchain, is generally used for transfers of cryptocurrencies. The technology provides full transparency and high speed of transactions. All translation process takes only a few minutes and costs ten times cheaper than bank. If you store money and information in a blockchain, records will never be lost or forged.

                                Cryptocurrency call a special kind of electronic means of payment. Strictly speaking, it is a mathematical code. So it is called because at the address of this digital money cryptographic elements are used digital signature. In this system ‘’coin’’ are considered as a unit of measure. The cryptocurrency has no real expression of type of metal coins or paper banknotes. This money exists only in a digital form.

                                The basic line distinguishing cryptomoney from the real is the way of their emergence in digital space. So, real means of payment are required to be deposited into a certain account or an e-wallet in the beginning, and cryptomonetary units appear in electronic form initially. "Release" of digital money happens in various ways: ICO (primary placement of coins, system of investment), mining (maintenance of the special platform for creation of new cryptomoney), forzhing (formation of new blocks in already available cryptocurrencies). That is the cryptocurrency arises directly from the Internet.

                                Other important difference from usual currency consists in release decentralization. The release of electronic currency represents generation of a mathematical code with the subsequent digital signature. The Central Bank has right to issue only real money. But crypto money can release any person. To make operations by means of cryptocurrency, it isn't necessary to contact with any third-party organizations (banks).

The exception is the Exchange, through which cryptomanias can be monetized, that is, switch to the usual methods of payment. The address of such currency happens on the blockchain system. This system represents the database distributed millions of personal computers around the world. At the same time storage and data recording at the address of cryptomoney happens on all devices at once that guarantees absolute transparency and openness of the made transactions.

                                The popularity of cryptocurrency is caused by requirements of time. In a century of universal distribution of information technologies universal means of payment which it would be possible to pay off in electronic space without binding to a certain country or establishment are extremely demanded. The cryptocurrency became such means. For payments with virtual money only their number therefore the cryptocurrency doesn't need in real terms is used. Digital means of payment are protected by a cryptographic code that does them by more reliable in comparison with real money. And owing to absolute decentralization of issue of virtual coins, they can't be forged and forbidden.
